But they also violates Brazil‚Äôs own laws.  Today, I wrote my regulatory counterparts in Brazil to address these unlawful actions.  ***** Dear ANATEL President Baigorri, \xa0 The FCC and ANATEL, the lead communications regulatory agencies in the U.S. and Brazil, have had a long-standing relationship‚Äîone built on reciprocity, respect for the rule of law, and our shared status as independent agencies established by law to operate without undue influence from the partisan political branches of our governments. \xa0  The sectors we regulate stand to benefit from continuing a partnership based on adherence to those foundational principles. \xa0Indeed, you recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the FCC‚Äôs Chairwoman that further formalized the FCC and ANATEL relationship. \xa0 Nonetheless, I am compelled to address with you today the cascading set of apparently unlawful and partisan political actions that your agency has been carrying out against businesses with U.S. ties, including your own threat to pull Starlink‚Äôs licenses and authorizations to operate in Brazil. \xa0  These punitive actions‚Äîbacked publicly by the Lula Administration‚Äîare already reverberating broadly and shaking confidence in the stability and predictability of Brazil‚Äôs regulated markets. \xa0In fact, U.S. business leaders are now openly questioning whether Brazil is on the path to becoming an uninvestable market. \xa0 ANATEL is now actively enforcing a widely criticized decision by Justice de Moraes to censor X that, according to government officials in Brazil, violates Brazil‚Äôs own Constitution and your country‚Äôs statutory prohibitions against government censorship. \xa0  To make matters worse, Justice de Moraes chose to enforce his decision by freezing the assets of Starlink‚Äîeven though Starlink is a separate company with different shareholders that has broken no laws.  Justice de Moraes has failed to respect universal and basic tenets of transparency, fair notice, and due process. \xa0  Indeed, it has now been revealed that Justice de Moraes has been sending social media companies secret orders to censor the political posts of elected members of Brazil‚Äôs Congress. \xa0  ‚ÄúIf this sounds authoritarian, it is,‚Äù the Washington Post wrote this week about Justice de Moraes‚Äôs takedown campaign. \xa0Continuing, the Washington Post stated that Brazil‚Äôs recent moves come ‚Äúat a substantial cost to free expression‚Äîwith mandates for removals and even arrest warrants often issued under seal and with scant reasoning to support them.‚Äù   ‚ÄúBrazilians shouldn‚Äôt have to put up with government suppressing political viewpoints,‚Äù it concluded. \xa0 While Justice de Moraes‚Äôs actions mirror crackdowns on free speech that are taking place across the globe, I am not writing you today based on a generalized concern about free expression‚Äîthough I believe strongly that communications regulators like us should stand against this trend towards censorship. \xa0Nor am I arguing that these actions by Brazil‚Äôs government somehow violate U.S. laws on free speech ‚Ä¶ \xa0 But according to Brazilian officials and legal authorities, Brazil is now violating its own laws through arbitrary and capricious actions against X and Starlink. \xa0Indeed, the Justice de Moraes decision runs headlong into Brazil‚Äôs own Constitution, which expressly prohibits ‚Äú[a]ny and all censorship of a political, ideological and artistic nature,‚Äù as well as other provisions of Brazilian law that further guarantee freedom of expression. \xa0 The serious and apparently unlawful actions against X and Starlink cannot be squared with the principles of reciprocity, rule of law, and independence that have served as the foundation of the FCC and ANATEL relationship and the basis for reciprocal foreign investment. \xa0 I am therefore requesting a meeting with you to address and resolve these issues. \xa0If you prefer, I will come to you in Brazil to do so.', 'quoted_user': 'Brendan Carr', 'quoted_link': 'https://twitter.com/BrendanCarrFCC/status/1831777881296662802#m'}",,Thank youNo retweet,No retweet,,
